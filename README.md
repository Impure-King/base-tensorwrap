# TensorWrap
 A Jax-based wrapper that is supposed to give a familiar interface for TensorFlow users.
 It is designed to act as an education tool, and a smooth transition between TensorFlow and Jax, by offering a smoother and faster API with more customizability with JAX, while still retaining TF 2.0 qualities.
 Currently, it is in beta and not accessible for public-use.
