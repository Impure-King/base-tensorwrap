# TensorWrap - A full-fledged Deep Learning Library based on JAX and TensorFlow.

![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/tensorwrap)

| [**Install guide**](#installation)


## What is TensorWrap?

TensorWrap is high performance neural network library that acts as a wrapper around [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) (another high performance machine learning library), bringing the familiar feel of the [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) (2.x.x). This is currently aimed towards prototyping over deployment, in the current state. 

TensorWrap works by creating a layer of abstraction over JAX's low level api and introducing similar TensorFlow-like component's while supporting Autograd in native JAX operations. Additionally, the api has been updated to become more simpler and concise than TensorFlow's current API, by removing the redundant API's and deprecations that it possesses. Additionally, this library aims to improve the poor design of the TensorFlow API and making it more friendly towards research and educational audiences.

This is a personal project, not professionally affliated with Google in any way. Expect bugs and several incompatibilities/difference from the original libraries.
Please help by trying it out, [reporting
bugs](https://github.com/Impure-King/base-tensorwrap/issues), and letting me know what you

### Examples

1) Custom Layers
```python
import tensorwrap as tf
from tensorwrap import nn

class Dense(nn.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units) -> None:
        super().__init__() # Needed for making it JIT compatible.
        self.units = units # Defining the output shape.
        self.built = True # Needed to avoid recompilation.
  
    def build(self, input_shape: tuple) -> None:
        self.kernel = self.add_weights([input_shape[-1], self.units],
                                       initializer = 'glorot_uniform')
        self.bias = self.add_weights([self.units],
                                     initializer = 'zeros')
        super().build(input_shape) # Needed to check dimensions and build.
    
    # Use call not __call__ to define the flow. No tf.function needed either.
    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs @ self.kernel + self.bias
```

2) Just In Time Compiling with tf.function
```python
import tensorwrap as tf
from tensorwrap import nn
tf.test.is_device_available(device_type = 'cuda')

@tf.function
def mse(y_pred, y_true):
    return tf.mean(tf.square(y_pred - y_true))

print(mse(100, 102))
```
3) Customizing with Module Class
```python 

class CheckPoint(Module):
    def __init__(self, metrics) -> None:
        

```


### Current Gimmicks
1. Current models are all compiled by JAX's internal jit, so any error may remain a bit more cryptic than PyTorchs. However, this problem is still being worked on.

2. Also, using ``tensorwrap.Module`` is currently not recommended, since other superclasses offer more functionality and ease of use.

3. Sometime, the JAX backend may give out and give an algorithmic error. Another high priority, though this one is hidden in the C++ api of JIT.

4. The JIT compilation is currently double of TensorFlow's on big models. However, the speed up is immense.

5. Graph execution is currently not available, which means that all exported models can only be deployed within a python environment.


### Installation

The device installation of TensorWrap depends on its backend, being JAX. Thus, our normal install will be covering both the GPU and CPU installation.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade tensorwrap
```

On Linux, it is often necessary to first update `pip` to a version that supports
`manylinux2014` wheels. Also note that for Linux, we currently release wheels for `x86_64` architectures only, other architectures require building from source. Trying to pip install with other Linux architectures may lead to `jaxlib` not being installed alongside `jax`, although `jax` may successfully install (but fail at runtime). 
**These `pip` installations do not work with Windows, and may fail silently; see
[above](#installation).**

**Note**

If any problems occur with cuda installation, please visit the [JAX](www.github.com/google/jax) github page, in order to understand the problem with lower API installation.

## Citations

This project have been heavily inspired by __TensorFlow__ and once again, is built on the open-source machine learning XLA framework __JAX__. Therefore, I recognize the authors of JAX and TensorFlow for the exceptional work they have done and understand that my library doesn't profit in any sort of way, since it is merely an add-on to the already existing community.
